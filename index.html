      <h2>The key to stopping the spread of the virus is to lower connectivity</h2>
      <p>
        Every time the virus does not infect another person, it has a massive impact on reducing the growth of overall
        infections. The better informed we all are on the actions we can take, the better we will serve our most
        vulnerable loved ones and our healthcare infrastructure at large.
      </p>
      <p>
        Without intervention, it is estimated that an individual with the virus will infect on average 3-4 other
        people, resulting in an exponential increase in the number of cases over time. If social connectivity can be
        lowered such that the average number of people that an individual with the virus infects is less than one other
        person, the number of cases will exponentially decrease over time instead.

      <h3>Why are people so afraid of this outbreak, isn't it just like the normal flu?</h3>
      <p>
        The Coronavirus causes about 20% severe cases and 2% deaths. This is about 20 times higher than the flu.
      </p>
      <p>
        A typical incubation period is 3 days but it may extend to 14 days, and reports exist of 24 and 27 days.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is highly contagious with an increase from day to day of 50% in new cases (infection rate R0 of about 3-4)
        unless
        extraordinary interventions are made.
