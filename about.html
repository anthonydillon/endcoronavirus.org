title: About us
---
<p>
  <a href="/">endCoronavirus.org</a> is built and maintained by the <a href="https://necsi.edu/">New England
    Complex
    Systems Institute (NECSI)</a> and collaborators. Our
  goal is to minimize the impact of COVID-19 by providing useful data and guidelines for action.
</p>
<p>
  Our research team has co-faculty, students and affiliates from MIT, Harvard, Brandeis and other universities
  nationally
  and internationally. We are working around the clock to monitor and communicate the current state of the
  COVID-19
  epidemic.
</p>
<p>
  We employ a range of mathematical tools designed for systems with many interacting components in which
  traditional
  statistical assumptions break down.
</p>
<p>
  We specialize in networks, agent-based modeling, multi-scale analysis, and complexity, and have applied our
  approaches to evolution, ecology, biodiversity, altruism, systems biology, cellular response, health care,
  systems
  engineering, negotiation, military conflict, ethnic violence, and international development.

<h2>Call to Action</h2>
<p>
  COVID-19 is a rapidly transmitting disease that evolves in 20% of cases to require extended hospitalizations and
  roughly
  2-4% of cases result in death, with risks increasing rapidly for those over 50 years old. It can transmit even
  with mild
  symptoms (coughing, sneezing, or elevated temperature) and perhaps before symptoms appear. Reducing the
  likelihood
  of
  transmission requires everyone to reduce their likelihood of contact not only so they aren’t infected but also
  so
  that
  they don’t transmit the disease to others.
</p>
<p>
  If everyone got tested for COVID-19, we could temporarily separate the infected from the uninfected. This would
  help
  reduce the spread of the virus and allow for societies to function normally. For these reasons, universal
  testing
  is our
  highest priority.
</p>
<p>
  Aggressive and bold actions are required to reduce transmission by minimizing close-contact interaction in order
  to
  reduce vulnerability and risk for individuals, but also to “get ahead” of the outbreak so that it is stopped.
</p>
<p>
  Everyone can help.
