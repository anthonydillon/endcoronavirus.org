      <h2>About us</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="/">endCoronavirus.org</a> is built and maintained by the <a href="https://necsi.edu/">New England
          Complex
          Systems Institute (NECSI)</a> and collaborators. Our
        goal is to minimize the impact of COVID-19 by providing useful data and guidelines for action.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our research team has co-faculty, students and affiliates from MIT, Harvard, Brandeis and other universities
        nationally
        and internationally. We are working around the clock to monitor and communicate the current state of the
        COVID-19
        epidemic.
      </p>
      <p>
        We employ a range of mathematical tools designed for systems with many interacting components in which
        traditional
        statistical assumptions break down.
      </p>
      <p>
        We specialize in networks, agent-based modeling, multi-scale analysis, and complexity, and have applied our
        approaches to evolution, ecology, biodiversity, altruism, systems biology, cellular response, health care,
        systems
        engineering, negotiation, military conflict, ethnic violence, and international development.

      <h2>Call to Action</h2>
      <p>
        COVID-19 is a rapidly transmitting disease that evolves in 20% of cases to require extended hospitalizations and
        roughly
        2-4% of cases result in death, with risks increasing rapidly for those over 50 years old. It can transmit even
        with mild
        symptoms (coughing, sneezing, or elevated temperature) and perhaps before symptoms appear. Reducing the
        likelihood
        of
        transmission requires everyone to reduce their likelihood of contact not only so they aren’t infected but also
        so
        that
        they don’t transmit the disease to others.
      </p>
      <p>
        If everyone got tested for COVID-19, we could temporarily separate the infected from the uninfected. This would
        help
        reduce the spread of the virus and allow for societies to function normally. For these reasons, universal
        testing
        is our
        highest priority.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aggressive and bold actions are required to reduce transmission by minimizing close-contact interaction in order
        to
        reduce vulnerability and risk for individuals, but also to “get ahead” of the outbreak so that it is stopped.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everyone can help.

            The Coronavirus causes about 20% severe cases and 2% deaths. This is about 20 times higher than the flu.
          </p>
          <p>
            A typical incubation period is 3 days but it may extend to 14 days, and reports exist of 24 and 27 days.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is highly contagious with an increase from day to day of 50% in new cases (infection rate R0 of about
            3-4)
            unless extraordinary interventions are made.
